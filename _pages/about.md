I am a Master's student in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://sti.epfl.ch/igm/) at [Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/). During my master
s study, I have the privilege of conducting the research projects, in BioRob at EPFL advised by [Prof. Auke Jan Ispeert](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/biorob/people/ijspeert/) and in RSL at ETH Zurich advised by [Prof. Marco Hutter](https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.MTIxOTEx.TGlzdC8yNDQxLC0xNDI1MTk1NzM1.html). My research interests lie in the field of robot learning and quadrupedal locomotion with Reinforcement Learning and Bio-inspired Control. Prior to joining EPFL, I completed my bachelor's degree at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan.
