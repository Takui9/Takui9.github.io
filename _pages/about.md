I am a Master’s student at [École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/about/), with a focus on computer vision and machine learning. I’m currently working as a research student focusing on parametrical diestortion free Structure-from-Motion at [ETHz](https://ethz.ch/en.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Marc Pollefeys](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/marc.pollefeys/) in [CVG](https://cvg.ethz.ch/). Previously, I spent some time in [VITA lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/vita/) conducting research on pose-estimation based lane marker detection, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Alexandre Alahi](https://people.epfl.ch/alexandre.alahi?lang=en). Prior to joining EPFL, my deep-seated interest in human-centric technology led me to conduct research on the spread mechanisms of respiratory diseases at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), CN, where I completed my bachelor’s degree, working under the supervision of [Prof. Jianjian Wei](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=N71FJjgAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW).

My research interest broadly lie in the field of 3D computer vision, spanning over geometry related 3D mapping, localization, as well as deep learning based vision applications including but not limited to autonomous vehicles.

I always enjoy peaceful reading time, with favorite writers being [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) and [Franz Kafka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka), starting to discover the beauty of [Kazuo Ishiguro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazuo_Ishiguro). I'm also interested in documentary literature and featured articles from journalism. In my spare time, I love to explore local culture via traveling, and do sports like swimming, occasionally :smile:
